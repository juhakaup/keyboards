# Dactyl Sygnus

This is a sub 40% Dactyl Manuform inspired ergonomic split keyboard.

## Warning! Work in progress!

If you want to print a version for yourself, you may need to modify the prints to get the parts to fit properly.

I consider this still to be a prototype. Although it is very usable at this stage.

Here is some modifications I'm planning to make:
  * Make the upper and lower halves fit better together.
  * Better placement for fasteners and feet.
  * Support for different sizes of micro-controllers.
  * Refine the shape a bit.
  * Support a few more configurations.
  * Rework the Fusion 360 file for the possible release.

## 3D printed parts
There are two versions of the case at the moment: with or without hot swap sockets.

To use the hot swap sockets, you need to print the separate left and right files of the case top.
For the version without the hot swap sockets, you can just mirror the noswap version of the top.
The case bottom is the same for all versions and can be mirrored to print the left hand side.

The controller holder bracker is designed to fit a 35mm x 17.7mm pro-micro clone. You need to print a mirrored version for the left side.

The trrs holder support thing does not need to be mirrored.

## Other parts

The hot melt insert nuts are M3 x D4.6 x L5.0.

I used various lengths of countersunk M3 machine screws, and a couple of M3 nuts for each half.

The part number for the jack is PJ-320A.
